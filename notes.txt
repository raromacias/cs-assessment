After looking at these results, tinyArray and smallArray run faster
on the doublerInsert function. But once you use the mediumArray and increase
the size of the array, the doublerAppend function is faster. This occurs because
the doublerAppend function utilizes a push method which only relies on one action,
while the doublerInsert function relies on unshift which loops over the whole array
which makes it an O(n) operation. The bigger the array the more values the 
doublerInsert function has to move over an index in order to perform the unshift method.
So the doublerAppend function scales better.
